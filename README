Speed tables is a high-performance memory-resident database. The speed
table compiler reads a table definition and generates a set of C
access routines to create, manipulate and search tables containing
millions of rows. Currently oriented towards Tcl.  Licensed under BSD Copyright.

This repository consists of three separate Tcl packages:

* ctables -- the primary package providing single-process and shared-memory tables.
* ctable_server -- networked client and server interface using "sttp:" URI syntax.
* stapi -- abstraction to allow ctables, ctable_server, and other interchangable object use.
